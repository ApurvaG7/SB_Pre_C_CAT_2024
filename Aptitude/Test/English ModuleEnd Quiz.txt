14. Read the following  passage and choose the best option for each Question -

	The fear that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robots will automate many jobs has been growing as technological change accelerates. Some studies have predicted that 40-50% of US jobs could be automated in the next 20 years, and many people are worried that they could be forced into retirement.
	The world has navigated a number of industrial revolutions in the past: First Industrial Revolution - Steam & Mechanical Production - 1700s & 1800s, Second Industrial Revolution - Electricity & Mass Production 1870 to 1914, Third Industrial Revolution - Digital Revolution -1980s, Fourth Industrial Revolution - AI, Robotics, Networks, Biotechnology, Internet of Things– Today.
	Each time many jobs were lost, but we created new ones and overall employment stayed high after the initial disruption. But this time it feels different partly due to the fact that real wage growth has been low to flat for many people meaning their standard of living isn’t rising. As we’ve become more productive through automation and globalization the share of GDP that goes to labor has fallen, while the share to capital has risen. Basically it’s better to be an investor rather than a worker - unless you have special skills.
	Is the fear overblown? Some experts say yes. I spoke with Ken Goldberg, a UC Berkeley Robotics Professor and Eric Brewer, a VP at Google and UC Berkeley Computer Science Professor about AI Automation and the Future of Work on a recent podcast. Both felt that the fears around AI and Robotics destroying jobs or worse leading to the Singularity where AI takes over are overblown. The Singularity is a term promoted by Ray Kurzweil which predicts
that based on Moore’s law and the doubling of computing power per dollar every few years that: by 2023 a $1,000 computer will have the processing power of 1 human brain; by 2030 the Singularity will occur and runaway AI will emerge; by 2050 a $1,000 computer will have the processing power of all human brains.
	Both Professors feel that predictions like self-driving cars will take much longer to play out, and that while some industries may face big disruptions. The jobs that get automated will be the boring mundane jobs which will be replaced by more interesting, creative jobs. Ken Goldberg in particular believes “Rather than worrying about an impending Singularity, consider instead the concept of Multiplicity: where diverse combinations of people and machines work together to solve problems and innovate.”They are both hopeful for the future where we all learn new skills faster and live more diverse rich lives. Eric Brewer shared “I feel like our kids will grow up in a generation that expects that they can do whatever they want at any time. That’s super empowering.”
